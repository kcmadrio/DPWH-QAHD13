                                        Government information is a pearl, meant to be shared with the public in order

                                        The Transparency Seal, depicted by a pearl shining out of an open shell, is a

                                        On the one hand, it hopes to inspire Filipinos in the civil service to be more
                                        open to citizen engagement; on the other, to invite the Filipino citizenry to
                                        exercise their right to participate in governance.<br><br>

                                        This initiative is envisioned as a step in the right direction towards
                                        solidifying the position of the Philippines as the Pearl of the Orient - a
                                        shining example for democratic virtue in the region.<br><br>
